# **Feature 1** - Changing Block Color
    - Changing block color will change the color of the block once it is frozen
        - to do this we create a new class called "FrozenColor"
        -FrozenColor will have a method "change_color" that takes a figure as a parameter
            -change_color() will change the figure color to GREY (a predefined constant color) that shows the player that the piece is no longer in play.
